# Live Chat Backend Service

Welcome to the backend service of our Live Chat project! This part of the project handles server-side logic and real-time communication for the chat application.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The foundation of our backend, providing a runtime environment for JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: Used for creating APIs and managing routes.
- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time communication for instant messaging.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing chat data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM library for MongoDB, simplifying database operations.
- **Nodemon**: Keeps the server running smoothly during development, allowing quick iterations.
